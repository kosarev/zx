;   This test is supposed to make visible possible defects in ULA
;   emulation with regard to how it renders border areas. It
;   proceeds in two steps. First, it makes sure that the ISR code
;   gets control at a specific frame tick. Then, on every frame
;   it draws 16 lines on the top border right above the screen
;   area so that the first line starts by an 'OUT (0xfe), A'
;   instruction which last tick is the beginning of the 48th
;   scanline (48 * 224 = 10752) and every subsequent line starts
;   by another 'OUT (0xfe), A' instruction 225 ticks later,
;   meaning every new line is placed on the next scanline and
;   shifted right by one CPU tick.
;
;   Here's how the test syncs calling the ISR with activation of
;   the ~INT signal. The first time the ISR gets control, we know
;   ~INT became active at one of the four ticks (T states) of the
;   HALT's M1 cycle:
;
;   -------  ------ M1 -------
;   T3 | T4  T1 | T2 | T3 | T4
;                           ^^ ~INT goes active here or
;
;   - M1 -------  ------ M1 -------
;   T2 | T3 | T4  T1 | T2 | T3 | T4
;                           ^^ ~INT goes active here or
;
;   ------ M1 -------  ------ M1 -------
;   T1 | T2 | T3 | T4  T1 | T2 | T3 | T4
;                           ^^ ~INT goes active here or
;
;        ------ M1 -------  ------ M1 -------
;        T1 | T2 | T3 | T4  T1 | T2 | T3 | T4
;                           ^^ ~INT goes active here.
;
;   Then, on every frame the ISR takes one tick longer than usual
;   until the number of executed M1 cycles of the HALT
;   instruction is changed, which can only happen if we reached
;   the T4 of the previous M1 cycle:
;
;            ------ M1 -------  ------ M1 -------
;            T1 | T2 | T3 | T4  T1 | T2 | T3 | T4
;                           ^^ ~INT goes active here.
;
;   At this point we know ~INT will be sampled at T4 of the first
;   M1 cycle, so the CPU will start the 19 ticks long
;   sequence calling the IM2 ISR immediately after that T4 tick.
;   This means the ISR will get control at tick 20.
